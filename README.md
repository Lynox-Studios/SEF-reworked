# SEF-reworked <br><sup>This is the official repository for SEF Development.</sup>

SEF, on its own is a terribly copied clone of ELF that doesn't come near close to it in anyway but it is made in C# so it's ok, it also barely identifies as an executable format. It stands for "Simple Executable Format".

SEF as it may seem is not really a pure executable format, it is not bootstrapped neither it has a hex editable format, it is basically low-level instructions placed in a hex string format, it may not be a surprise in that case but it's by technical terms, a low-level Kernel interpreter. So yes, it is false advertising, I don't know what to do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

To get to know in far more detail about SEF you may check the docs and all here.
